TAStringDataStructures
======================
This library contains Objective-C based data structures that are optimized for strings.  Currently it only includes a Trie implementation, but I will continue to add more (next up is a suffix tree).

In order to use this you may

1. Download source and copy into project
2. Download source and build as framework
3. Use Cocoapods


For an example of how to use the Trie, as well as an example PodFile, please see https://github.com/tdansel88/FastTextSearch
